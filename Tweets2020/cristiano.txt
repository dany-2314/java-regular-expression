My clear conscious will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations.
I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense.
Aguardarei com tranquilidade o resultado de quaisquer investigações e processos, pois nada me pesa na consciência.
Nego terminantemente as acusações de que sou alvo. Considero a violação um crime abjecto, contrário a tudo aquilo que sou e em que acredito. Não vou alimentar o espectáculo mediático montado por quem se quer promover à minha custa.
Complimenti ragazzi per un’altra importante vittoria! #forzajuve https://t.co/um9zihs1yp

Everything else is pure fiction and forgery.
I was in fact at the Hotel Villa Magna on April 22nd giving an interview to Manu Sainz something the reporter himself is able to corroborate

...someone seeking the limelight on my account.
And I wonder why this happens one day before a very important game for my team…
I was informed that The Sun, faithful to its editorial line, will publish an article where is given voice to a so called Andressa...
