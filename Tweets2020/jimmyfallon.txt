@CollegeofStRose @FallonTonight Made my day. Thank you guys!
Preparing to see my first @deadandcompany show on October 31st at @TheGarden. My friend @Andy is helping me prep by sending three songs a week to listen to and learn. What is on the must listen list?
@ParentOutpost @blainecapatch I‚Äôd screw it up. It was something about getting the bad side effects to being bit by a spider. I think he said he had the ability to crouch in small corners.
I never knew I shared a birthday with @blainecapatch. I love that guy. I was lucky open for him once back in the day. He had a great Spider Man joke that I always loved. Happy birthday!
He got me with the double bird. https://t.co/lgiRFaOz9c

@FallonTonight @JimmyFallon No, good sir, How Dare YOU! Your untoward cry in the late hour of OREO Thins is blaspheme in the highest degree! But, though their wafers be thin, their capacity for forgiveness is unbounded‚Ä¶ you are thus absolved of the offense.
